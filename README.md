### About me...

:computer: ::: I'm a staff research scientist in [Dr. Aaron Quinlan's group](http://quinlanlab.org) at the University of Utah.

:dna: ::: I'm broadly interested in studying mutation rate evolution using a variety of statistical methods and DNA sequencing technologies.

:open_book: ::: Check out some of my previous work [identifying mutator alleles in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04701-5), [measuring mutation rates in large human families](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46922), and [figuring out how DNA viruses rapidly evolve](https://elifesciences.org/articles/35453).
