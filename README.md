### About me...

:dna: ::: Before that, I studied mutation rate evolution using a variety of statistical methods and DNA sequencing technologies.

:open_book: ::: Check out some of my previous work [identifying mutator alleles in mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.435196v1), [measuring mutation rates in large human families](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46922), and [figuring out how DNA viruses rapidly evolve](https://elifesciences.org/articles/35453).
