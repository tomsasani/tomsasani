### About me

I'm a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Kelley Harris at the University of Washington.

I study the rates and patterns of mutation in humans and model systems using a variety of sequencing-based approaches.

Check out some of my recent work [identifying mutator alleles in mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.435196v1), [measuring mutation rates in large human families](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46922), and [figuring out how DNA viruses rapidly evolve](https://elifesciences.org/articles/35453).
